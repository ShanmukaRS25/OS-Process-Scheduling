# OS-Process-Scheduling
Process scheduling is a key component of operating systems, responsible for managing the execution of multiple processes concurrently on a single CPU (Central Processing Unit). The primary goal of process scheduling is to efficiently utilize CPU resources, ensure fairness among processes, and provide responsive system performance. Here's an explanation of process scheduling:

### 1. **Process**:
   - A process is an instance of a running program. It consists of program code, data, and resources (such as memory and CPU time) required for execution.
   - Each process has its own state, including the program counter, register values, and other execution-related information.

### 2. **CPU Scheduling**:
   - CPU scheduling is the process of selecting and allocating CPU resources to different processes in a system.
   - The CPU scheduler is a part of the operating system responsible for making scheduling decisions based on scheduling algorithms.

### 3. **Scheduling Algorithms**:
   - Scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes are selected to run on the CPU.
   - Different scheduling algorithms prioritize different aspects such as throughput, response time, fairness, and resource utilization.
   - Common scheduling algorithms include:
     - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Processes are executed in the order they arrive, like a queue.
     - **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: Processes with the shortest burst time are executed first to minimize waiting time.
     - **Round Robin (RR)**: Each process is executed for a small time slice (quantum), and then moved to the end of the queue, ensuring fairness.
     - **Priority Scheduling**: Processes are assigned priorities, and higher-priority processes are executed first.
     - **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**: Processes are divided into multiple queues with different priority levels, and scheduling is performed within each queue.
     - **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**: Similar to multilevel queue scheduling, but processes can move between different queues based on their behavior.

### 4. **Context Switching**:
   - When the CPU switches from executing one process to another, it performs a context switch.
   - Context switching involves saving the state of the currently running process and loading the state of the next process to be executed.
   - Context switches incur overhead due to the time required to save and restore process states, impacting system performance.

### 5. **Scheduling Criteria**:
   - Scheduling decisions are based on various criteria, including:
     - CPU utilization: Maximizing CPU usage to keep the system busy.
     - Throughput: Maximizing the number of processes completed per unit of time.
     - Turnaround time: Minimizing the time taken to execute a process from submission to completion.
     - Waiting time: Minimizing the time processes spend waiting in the ready queue.
     - Response time: Minimizing the time taken to respond to user input or requests.

### 6. **Real-Time Scheduling**:
   - Real-time scheduling is used for systems with strict timing requirements, such as embedded systems and control systems.
   - Real-time scheduling algorithms guarantee that tasks are completed within specified deadlines, ensuring predictable system behavior.

### 7. **Dynamic Scheduling**:
   - Some operating systems support dynamic scheduling, where scheduling decisions are made dynamically based on system workload and resource availability.
   - Dynamic scheduling algorithms can adapt to changing system conditions to optimize performance and resource utilization.

In summary, process scheduling is a critical aspect of operating systems that involves selecting and prioritizing processes for execution on the CPU, utilizing various scheduling algorithms and criteria to ensure efficient resource management and responsive system performance.
